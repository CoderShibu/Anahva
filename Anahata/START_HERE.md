2. Run these commands:

```bash

npm run dev
```

3. Wait for the message: **"Local: http://localhost:5173"**
4. Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:5173**

## Login Information

- **Username:** `Shibasish`
- **Password:** `Shibasish`

## If Browser Doesn't Load

1. Make sure you see "Local: http://localhost:5173" in the terminal
2. Try these URLs:
   - http://localhost:5173
   - http://127.0.0.1:5173
3. Check if another port is shown in the terminal (Vite will use the next available port)
4. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
5. Try a different browser

## Troubleshooting

### "npm: command not found"
- Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
- Restart your terminal after installation

### "Port already in use"
- Close other applications using port 5173
- Or let Vite use the next available port (check terminal output)

### "Module not found"
- Run: `npm install`
- Make sure you're in the Anahva folder

## Need Help?

Check the terminal output for error messages. The server must be running for the browser to load!
